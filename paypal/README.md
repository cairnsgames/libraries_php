To install dependencies in a Composer project, follow these steps:

Open a terminal in the directory where your Composer project is located (where the composer.json file exists).

Run the following command:
```
composer install
```
This command will read the composer.json file and install all listed dependencies into the vendor directory.

Verify installation: After the process completes, you should see a vendor folder containing all dependencies.
